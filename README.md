生存人生会倾落那些点点滴滴。
到了咱们卓尼，固然要去参观一下千年庙宇禅定寺。我从搜集上，见到过世纪前卓尼禅定庙宇里进行法会的老像片，也看到了此刻庙宇里的时势，更加是本年一月十六日，庙宇里法会情景的视频及系列图片，感触颇多。
　　草原的气候是多变的，刚才已经晴朗的天空此刻乌云密布，大滴的雨点砸在汽车的玻璃上，接着是一阵噼里啪啦的暴雨，马路上顿时成了一片水洼，我们在车窗里也再看不到外面的世界了。
45, if we are children, they can stay in the in situ time, sit together, listen to those who never old stories side slowly hoary head.
Happy birthday to myself!
Because still single, and have a job, can not like the villagers in their field, have done the work of forever.
So, for the delay in the countryside life depressed me, often at the weekend in a bicycle to go to the railway station of the county, have saved the car, and then grab a around the city, to train ran all the way over.
Is not far, to the one or two hours, went there, and nothing else, just find a little food stands, eat slowly, watching the men of the city, in the bright lights on the streets of random walk, talk, leisurely shopping, or, smartly to dance.
Lit the lamp has been bright to 11 and 2 o 'clock at night, people just lazily.
At that time, feel that this city is a paradise, don't know what time I can become a member in paradise.
